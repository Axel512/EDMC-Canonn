# EDMC-Canonn
EDMC plugin to automatically collect accurate science data from the galaxy and coordinate missions

Features will be added in the Project Board

# Important

This plugin is currently only writing to the Canonn API and therefore anything you log may not end up being captured at this current time. Use the USS Survey plugin for the time being. 

# Features

## Hyperdiction reporting 
Hyperdiction reporting is logges from the Thargoid Encounter Stats screen. 

## NHSS Reporting
This captures NHSS information from the FSS scanner and USS Drops. Only logs one instance of each threat level per system

## Codex
This records the codex entries and a bit of extra info about body and lat lon

## Thargoid Kills 
This records Thargoids kils. What else did you expect herds of wilderbeast running through the serengeti?

## Journal Data
This records all journal entries that haven't specifically been excluded. Warning the exclusion list needs to be bigger.
