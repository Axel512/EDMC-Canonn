# EDMC-Canonn
EDMC plugin to automatically collect accurate science data from the galaxy and coordinate missions

Features will be added in the Project Board

# Important

This plugin is currently only writing to the Canonn API and therefore anything you log may not end up being captured at this current time. Use the USS Survey plugin for the time being. NB The USS Survey and Canonn survey are not compatible when run together unless you are on the same version
